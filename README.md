<h2>Demo</h2>

<p>A working demo is available at https://liambell.info/portfolio/chess/ </p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>This app was built using Create-React-App. Node must be installed to compile the source files.</p>

<h2>Building / Deployment</h2>
<p>Once downloaded, in the project root folder run the following commands: <br />
	npm i
	npm run build
</p>

<p>This will create a build directory that contains a production build of the app. 
You can then deploy the app as required, for example using a static server. <br />
See https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/ for more information about deploying.
